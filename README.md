# Stroke Risk Prediction
This repository contain the data for the Set Practical Exercise


## 📄 Project Overview

Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide, with over 12 million first‐ever strokes and 6.5 million stroke‐related deaths each year. Early identification of individuals at high risk enables timely intervention and prevention.

## 🗂 Dataset


- **Description:** 5 110 patient records, 12 columns (11 predictors + binary stroke outcome).  
  - Predictors include demographic (`gender`, `age`), clinical (`hypertension`, `heart_disease`, `avg_glucose_level`, `bmi`), and lifestyle factors (`ever_married`, `work_type`, `Residence_type`, `smoking_status`).  
  - Target: `stroke` (0 = no, 1 = yes; ~4.9 % positive cases).
